We understand concepts like perceptron, activation functions, backpropagation, gradient descent, learning rate, and how build it from scratch without any framework and build multi layers neural networks from scratch and applied to classification and regression tasks

And implement neural networks in Python and Numpy from scratch

And implement neural networks using libraries, such as: sklearn and TensorFlow.

And Learn step by step all the mathematical calculations involving artificial neural networks
